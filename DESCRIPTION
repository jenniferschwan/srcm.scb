  bootstrap approaches and semiparametric estimators
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Jennifer", "Schwan", email = "schwan@fh-aachen.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package includes what is needed for my masters thesis.
  This means different semiparamtertic estimators for survival functions, 
  functions to calculate different types of simultaneous confidence bands, 
  function to plot these things as well as functions to calculate statistics 
  used to compare the scbs.
